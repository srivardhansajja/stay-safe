# Tool evaluation: 
 
Each team member's rating and commentary on the usefulness of each tool used in the semester project.

1. **Github:** Version control
   - **Tom Cochran:** 10/10
     - Excellent, especially for creating pull requests, creating test branches, and performing code review.
   - **Thomas Dolan:** 10/10
     - Awesome tool.  I liked that it has project management aspects to it, like assigning issues.
   - **Srivardhan Sajja:**
     - TODO


2. **Trello:** Task management
   - **Tom Cochran:** 5/10
     - Good for adding to the product backlog and organizing the sprint backlog.
   - **Thomas Dolan:** 8/10
     - Good tool for keeping the project moving forward.  I wish we had used it a bit more, but we really only had
     - three sprints and a couple spikes, so we didn't spend a whole lot of time using it.
   - **Srivardhan Sajja:**
     - TODO


3. **Zoom:** Meetings and pair programming sessions
   - **Tom Cochran:** 7/10
     - Acceptable for pair programming, though in person would likely be better. Excellent for remote meetings.
   - **Thomas Dolan:** 7/10
     - I agree with Tom; it worked well for our team but in-person would have been better.
   - **Srivardhan Sajja:**
     - TODO


4. **Slack:** Team member check-in's and updates
   - **Tom Cochran:** 10/10
     - Excellent for check-in's and sharing ideas.
   - **Thomas Dolan:** 10/10
     - Great for communication and I loved the fact that you could install additional apps.  Way better than email.
   - **Srivardhan Sajja:**
     - TODO


5. **Scrum:** Agile development framework
   - **Tom Cochran:** 8/10
     - Sprints worked well and reminded me of agile principles.
   - **Thomas Dolan:** 7/10
     - The framework really helped us focus on only what was important at the time.  Helped prevent "bikeshedding".
   - **Srivardhan Sajja:**
     - TODO


6. **Django:** Web development framework
   - **Tom Cochran:** 7/10
     - Difficult to learn from scratch, but I found its database API extremely useful.
   - **Thomas Dolan:**
     - I love the "batteries-included" nature.  It helps you get up and running fast with tools like the admin interface.
   - **Srivardhan Sajja:**
     - TODO*


7. **Testing:** Django unit tests
   - **Tom Cochran:** 10/10
     - The Django API made it easy to test the behavior of our app by querying database entries, getting form fields, accessing views, etc.
   - **Thomas Dolan:** 9/10
     - The Django framework has a ton built in.  It would be cool if there was some selenium functionality built in.
   - **Srivardhan Sajja:**
     - TODO


8. **Continuous Integration:** Travis CI
   - **Tom Cochran:** 7/10
     - Useful for catching issues when merging code. However, we still performed code review and rarely encountered issues merging code.
   - **Thomas Dolan:** 10/10
     - Definitely helped me sleep better at night.  Would be more useful with a bigger team/project though.
   - **Srivardhan Sajja:**
     - TODO

9. **Heroku:** Cloud platform as a service
   - **Tom Cochran:** 10/10
     - I found heroku very easy to learn and could quickly deploy our app without any hassle. This was particularly useful if I wanted to quickly deploy changes that I made in a local test branch.
   - **Thomas Dolan:** 10/10
     - I literally dropped a one-liner in the settings.py file and add a couple files and the codebase was deployment-ready.  That's efficiency!
   - **Srivardhan Sajja:**
     - TODO


10. **Code Editors:** Vim, VScode, PyCharm
    - **Tom Cochran:** 6/10
      - Vim was difficult to learn but I like that it's widely available and fully customizable. I'm still undecided if I will continue working with vim or go back to VScode.
    - **Thomas Dolan:** 10/10
      - I used PyCharm exclusively for this project because it has a lot of Django-specific plugins. It helped me catch a ton of syntax errors during development.
    - **Srivardhan Sajja:**
      - TODO

# Challenges encountered:
  - **Tom Cochran:**
    - **Learning Django**
      - This was by far the most difficult challenge for me because I had no previous experience with anything related to web development.
      - I overcame this by reading the official django documentation, reading a django textbook, writing various small apps unrelated to the project, and pair programming.
    - **Using git on a team**
      - Prior to this class, I had no experience merging code with others.
      - I overcame this by reading more about common git commands, asking questions to team members, and submitting frequent pull requests for review.
    - **Remote collaboration:**
      - All team members could not collaborate in person.
      - In my opinion, we as a team overcame this by being very proactive in learning and using all the tools available to us. Among these, daily slack updates and weekly zoom meetings were particularly useful to ensure we were all on the same page.

  - **Thomas Dolan:**
    - **Keeping up with Teammates**
      - Due to my courseload this summer, I sometimes had difficulty keeping up with the rapidly-changing codebase.  
      - To overcome this, I tried to read every Slack message/PR carefully to make sure that I wasn't falling behind.
    - **Debugging issues**
      - In the past, I had only ever had to debug issues where I introduced the bug.  Working as a team meant trying to reverse-engineer exactly what happened in someone else's code when the origin of the bug was unknown. 
      - I was happy to encounter this challenge because it is something that I will encounter in the future.  I developed a workflow that included trying to recreate the error and read error-messages carefully.
    - **Using git in a team environment**
      - I had only ever used git for personal projects (not team based).  I had to learn a ton of new commands so that I could work with the team. 
      - Stackoverflow was a useful resource for this.  I still don't have a great understanding of exactly what some of the commands did (ie. cherrypicking?) but at least now I know how to solve some common issues.
