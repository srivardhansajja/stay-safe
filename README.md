# Stay Safe

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/tjdolan121/3308_App.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/tjdolan121/3308_App)

## Vision Statement

Everyone knows they should notify a friend or family member about their trip plans in case of an emergency. But this can often be easy to forget or burdensome. 'Stay Safe' allows you to automatically notify an emergency contact if you have not returned from your trip safely. Simply open the app and enter the start and end dates of your trip. At the end of your trip, 'Stay Safe' checks if you have returned safely. If no response is heard, 'Stay Safe' will notify your emergency contacts with your trip details. 

## Motivation

We are motivated to create an application that will protect the safety of others. 'Stay Safe' allows the user to request help when they may be otherwise incapable of doing so.

## Risks to Project Completion

*  Team members have no experience working together and can only communicate remotely.
*  Team members have conflicting schedules and live in different time zones.
*  We must adjust to a development environment that involves using new tools on a regular basis, such as:
    - Agile software development methods and practices.
    - Kanban-style board to track workflow.
    - Collaborative use of version control.
*  Learning the Django web framework.

## Mitigation Strategies

*  Create remote meetings using [Zoom](https://www.zoom.us/).
*  Use [Slack](https://www.slack.com/) for flexible text-based communication at any time of the day.
*  Frequently engage with new project management tools, read their documentation, and ask questions.
*  Work through the [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/) documentation together and reference additional resources as needed, such as:
    - [Django Tutorial](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.0/intro/tutorial01/)
    - [Django for Beginners](https://djangoforbeginners.com/)
    - [Django for Professionals](https://djangoforprofessionals.com/)

## Development Methods

We use [Scrum](https://www.scrum.org/) as our agile software development method.

## Project Tracking Software

We use [Trello](https://www.trello.com/) to organize our workflow and [GitHub](https://www.github.com/) for version control.
